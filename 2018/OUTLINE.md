# General Outline
This is the general outline for the panel. It covers the general arch of the discussion and will be
used to keep the discussion going and keep things managable. Think something is missing or should be
moved? Feel free to comment or make a PR!

## Gentle intro:
_Purpose: Get the audience up to speed, so that no one feels left behind._
Estimated time: 5~ minutes

### Topics:
- What is TC39 and what does it do?
- what is your experience working on new features for the language (how did you get involved,
  features you feel strongly about, etc)

## In-depth discussion:
_Purpose: Get into some technical discussions. This will be pretty free-form. We could gently
ramp into the discussion by starting with some personal experience stuff and then move into
technical territory._
Estimated time: 10~ minutes

### Topics:
- What are the main language features that are under development?
- Classes and where they are going this year
- Proposal sepecific questions from the community

## This last year ...
_Purpose: Discuss some things that came up in the last year, and how the committee is handling them_
Estimated time: 5~ minutes

### Topics
- Smoosh -> flat
- bridging the gap between developers and the committee

## Getting people excited:
_Purpose: Round off the discussion, and get the community excited about the work that is being
done._
Estimated time: 10~ minutes

### Topics
- How is the community involved? (things like github comments, submitting features, trying stuff out
  using babel. This way people who are new to this topic realize "oh, I have been using that, and
  thats a contribution too!")
- where would you like to see it go in the future?
- Where do you see the community in the future?
- how can we help?
