# Final Draft
This draft contains the flow of the panel, plus potential questions that might be used to move it
along.

**Important Note on Panel Flow**

Since we only have 25 minutes, I will use a hand gesture to signal you if we need to move on or give someone a chance to speak.
Make sure to glance at me every now and then to see if I am signaling.

Gesture: **I will raise my hand while holding the pen.**

When you see this, please round off your point as best as possible with one or two sentences.

## Gentle intro:
_Purpose: Get the audience up to speed, so that no one feels left behind._

Estimated time: 5~ minutes

### Topics:
- Name, who you represent, feature you are most excited about
- What is TC39 and what does it do?
- four stages quickly
- what is consensus?

#### (Community) Questions:

What is the organization behind tc39

Why don’t you standardize lodash

I've not seen any movements on pattern matching proposal, is this proposal in idle state? Also if this proposal lands as a statement, what will be the heuristics to decide when using it or a chain of if/else? Do you think to have PM as an expression would be more beneficial?

I have seen proposal in may 2018 with a publication date of 2019, and other proposals are published
the year that they come out. why is that?

how long on average does it take to standardize a proposal


##### Long answers

## In-depth discussion:
_Purpose: Get into some interesting discussions. This will be pretty free-form. We could gently
ramp into the discussion by starting with some personal experience stuff and then move into
technical territory._

Estimated time: 12~ minutes

### Topics:
- What are the main language features that are under development?
- Classes and where they are going this year
- what is the feature you are most excited for? What would you like to see implemented?
- Proposal sepecific questions from the community

## Community
_Purpose: Round off the discussion, and get the community excited about the work that is being
done._

Estimated time: 5~ minutes

### Topics
- A better line of communication with developers

#### Community Questions

##### Rapid fire (one word answers)

Estimated Time: 3~ minutes


## Moderator Extra Questions
These questions will be used if we are going too fast and need to fill out a block of time somehow
(or if I end up brain dead and cannot formulate a question on the fly!)

These are My questions:


### Intro:

- What is TC39? (see if there is someone willing to give a quick intro)

- ECMAScript has a release cycle that has four stages, lets talk a bit about each of
these stages and what is involved.

- (regarding stage 3) Browsers and transpilers play a pretty important roll in testing out a new
feature. Lets talk a bit about the role that community plays

### In-depth Discussion:

- Let's start from a personal perspective, how did you start workin on the ECMA / JavaScript spec?
  What is your story?

- As a follow up question to how communities and the specification interact, how is building a specification different from doing opensource work?

- There are a lot of features that get worked on but do not necessarily make it to the
  language, and it would be interesting to discuss these as not failures, but learning
  points. Is there an example of an interesting feature that didn't make it into the
  language, or was depricated. In my experience, one such example is object.observe. some other examples are listed online [in the github page](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/inactive-proposals.md)
  Why it is a benefit (or a detriment) that it didnt make it in to the language specification?
  What is the process of deciding that "gee it doesnt work the way we wanted it to" and what
  can we take away from those moments?

### Community involvement:

- Ideally, where would you see the work by the TC39 going? How do you see the community developing?

- It can be overwhelming to start looking at contributing to a project like this. How can someone
  start?

- We talked at the beginning how the community is an important part of getting
  features approved. What about further ways people can get involved? Are there
  any forms of mentorship within the community? Any places where discussions
  take place where one could join?

## Past questions
### 2018
- Mark Doeswijk
@Qwerios
with all the new operators and features being added is JavaScript at risk of becoming too cryptic syntax wise for new developers? I'm very much in favor of them but web development being very approachable is a big boon

- Søren Bruus Frank
@soerenbf
When writing up new features, where do you look most for inspiration? Is it other languages (and which?) or is it mostly driven by requests from the community? #tc39panel

Typescript, ReasonML, PureScript, Babel, ...; JavaScript has become the target of many compilers. How much does this fact influence your work and the language in general? @jsconfeu #tc39panel

I notice the committee is very heavily dominated by Americans and American companies, particularly Google. Do you have any plans to become more representative of the world and only give certain companies so much power? @jsconfeu #tc39panel


would love to have a non expensive, non-library deep object comparison, any hope on that?

what's the mediam turnaround for a proposal becoming reality time wise? do all proposals follow the same procedure/timeline?

Could you tell us an interesting gotcha, if any, about a new upcoming feature, which a new developer might not realize easily

There seem to be two different focuses for proposals: OOP related (static/instance class fields) and FP (throw expressions, partial application). Do you feel like the criteria for accepting or rejecting drafts introduces language biases towards one trend?

### 2017

- Christian Kaestner speaking about how communities influence api's. Lets talk a bit about the roll of
  the community of developers around JS and how they influence the process for introducing features.
  With a project such as creating the spec for a language like JS, there are a lot of interested
  parties pushing for their interests to be added to the spec. How are vendors, such as browsers,
  influencing the development of new features? How do you balance the needs of JS developers and
  vendors?
