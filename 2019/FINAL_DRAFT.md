# Final Draft
This draft contains the flow of the panel, plus potential questions that might be used to move it
along.

**Important Note on Panel Flow**

Since we only have 25 minutes, I will use a hand gesture to signal you if we need to move on or give someone a chance to speak.
Make sure to glance at me every now and then to see if I am signaling.

Gesture: **I will raise my hand while holding the pen.**

When you see this, please round off your point as best as possible with one or two sentences.

## Gentle intro:
_Purpose: Get the audience up to speed, so that no one feels left behind._

Estimated time: 10~ minutes

### Topics:
- Name, who you represent, feature you are most excited about
- What is TC39 and what does it do?
- four stages quickly
- what is consensus?

### Questions to discuss:
Estimated time: 15~ minutes

- asked in person - What is the organization behind tc39?

Anyone can answer

- ECMAScript has a release cycle that has four stages, lets talk a bit about each of
these stages and what is involved.

Suggestion: Jason Williams talks about his experience getting Promise.allSettled through the process

- (regarding stage 3) Browsers and transpilers play a pretty important roll in testing out a new
feature. Lets talk a bit about the role that community plays

Suggestion: Henry talks a bit about babel

- (regarding test 262) How do we know how well the spec is implemented?

Suggestion: Valerie Young talks about test 262

- Recent changes to the TC39

New es discourse - Aki introduces it

## Community Questions:

#### What the committee looks like

- Sam Bason I notice the committee is very heavily dominated by Americans and American companies, particularly Google. Do you have any plans to become more representative of the world and only give certain companies so much power? @jsconfeu #tc39panel

#### How long to standardize

* Sérgio Vinícius - I have seen proposal in may 2018 with a publication date of 2019, and other proposals are published
the year that they come out. why is that?

* how long on average does it take to standardize a proposal

* what's the medium turnaround for a proposal becoming reality time wise? do all proposals follow the same procedure/timeline?

#### specific proposals

* Nikhil Ranjan - when are we getting a standard library for javascript?

* Why don’t you standardize lodash

* Willian Martins - I've not seen any movements on pattern matching proposal, is this proposal in idle state? Also if this proposal lands as a statement, what will be the heuristics to decide when using it or a chain of if/else? Do you think to have PM as an expression would be more beneficial?

* Leonard Koch @jsconfeu What are your thoughts on reducing the capabilities of the pattern matching proposal (expression -> statement) in favour of language cohesion? #tc39panel

* Boopathi Rajaa Will BigInt get into JSON specification as well ? #tc39panel

* Claudio Procida - Hi #tc39panel would a proposal to make JS objects immutable via keyword meet anyone's interest or consensus? #jsconfeu

* doberkofler #tc39panel #JSconfEU Static typing has become quite popular in JS. Should tc39 not standardize the type definition syntax?

* Iulia would love to have a non expensive, non-library deep object comparison, any hope on that?

#### Language design

* Marvin Hagemeister @JSConfEU Are there any longtime goals for JS? What's the bigger picture like for JS in 5 years?

* Typescript, ReasonML, PureScript, Babel, ...; JavaScript has become the target of many compilers. How much does this fact influence your work and the language in general? @jsconfeu #tc39panel

- Søren Bruus Frank - When writing up new features, where do you look most for inspiration? Is it other languages (and which?) or is it mostly driven by requests from the community? #tc39panel

* Nicolás Fantone - There seem to be two different focuses for proposals: OOP related (static/instance class fields) and FP (throw expressions, partial application). Do you feel like the criteria for accepting or rejecting drafts introduces language biases towards one trend?

* Mark Doeswijk with all the new operators and features being added is JavaScript at risk of becoming too cryptic syntax wise for new developers? I'm very much in favor of them but web development being very approachable is a big boon

## Extra topics

* Experimentation survey
