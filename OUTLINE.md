# General Outline
This is the general outline for the panel. It covers the general arch of the discussion and will be
used to keep the discussion going and keep things managable. Think something is missing or should be
moved? Feel free to comment or make a PR!

## Gentle intro:
_Purpose: Get the audience up to speed, so that no one feels left behind._
Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

### Topics:
- What is TC39 and what does it do?
- What are the main language features that are under development?
- How is the community involved? (things like github comments, submitting features, trying stuff out
  using babel. This way people who are new to this topic realize "oh, I have been using that, and
  thats a contribution too!")

## In-depth discussion:
_Purpose: Get into some interesting discussions. This will be pretty free-form. We could gently
ramp into the discussion by starting with some personal experience stuff and then move into
technical territory._
Estimated time: 15-20 minutes

### Topics:
- what is your experience working on new features for the language (how did you get involved,
  features you feel strongly about, etc)
- what is the collaborative process like?
- Technical questions (and twitter sourced questions)
- what are some interesting examples of things that didnt work, and what were the take aways?

## Getting people excited:
_Purpose: Round off the discussion, and get the community excited about the work that is being
done._
Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

### Topics
- where would you like to see it go in the future?
- Where do you see the community in the future?
- how can we help?
